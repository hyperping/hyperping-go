# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use the GitHub Security Advisory tab to report privately:
**[Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/hyperping/hyperping-go/security/advisories/new)**

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Affected versions
- Suggested fix, if known

### Response SLA

| Stage | Target |

| Acknowledgement | 48 hours |

We will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter. We follow [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure).

## Scope

This policy covers the **hyperping-go** codebase only.

**Out of scope:**
- Vulnerabilities in the Hyperping API itself, report to [Hyperping](https://hyperping.io) directly
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, report to the respective upstream project; we will update our dependency once a fix is released
- Issues requiring physical access to infrastructure

## No Bug Bounty

There is currently no reward programme for vulnerability reports. We deeply appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge reporters in the release notes (with permission).
